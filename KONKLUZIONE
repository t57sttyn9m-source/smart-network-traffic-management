5.1. Performance Synthesis 
The experimental results demonstrate that advanced Machine Learning models, specifically Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) and Transformer-based architectures, significantly outperform traditional baseline methods such as Naive Forecasting and Moving Averages. While baseline models failed to capture the non-linear "bursty" nature of network traffic, the ML models successfully identified daily periodicity and service-specific patterns.

Accuracy: The ML approach reduced the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) by over [X]% compared to the Moving Average baseline.

Pattern Recognition: Through Feature Importance and Heatmap analysis, it was verified that the model prioritized "Time of Day" and "Service Priority" as the primary drivers of bandwidth demand.

5.2. The Role of Uncertainty Quantification
A critical contribution of this work is the shift from "Point Forecasting" to "Probabilistic Forecasting." By utilizing GPR, we successfully quantified the prediction uncertainty. The generated 95% Confidence Intervals provided a dynamic safety margin, proving that ML is not just about predicting the "mean" demand, but about understanding the risk of under-allocation. This uncertainty serves as the fundamental bridge to the Robust Optimization framework.

5.3. Limitations of Pure ML
Despite the high accuracy, the research identifies two core limitations of a "Pure ML" approach:

Sensitivity to Anomalies: ML models are inherently retrospective; they predict based on historical patterns. In the event of unprecedented network spikes (Zero-day anomalies), pure ML tends to under-provision resources.

The "Average" Bias: Standard ML loss functions (like MSE) optimize for the average case. However, in mission-critical 5G/6G networks, we care more about the worst-case scenario to ensure 99.999% reliability.

5.4. Concluding Statement on ML-RO Integration
The work concludes that while Machine Learning provides the "intelligence" to understand traffic trends, it cannot stand alone in a carrier-grade environment. The optimal strategy for network resource management is a Data-Driven Robust Optimization approach. In this paradigm, ML provides the Uncertainty Set, and Robust Optimization provides the Guarantee. This synergy ensures a network that is both efficient (not over-provisioning) and resilient (protected against uncertainty).
